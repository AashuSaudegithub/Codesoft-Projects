## 📁 **Project List**

### 1. **Iris Flower Classification**
**Notebook:** `Iris project.ipynb`  
This project uses the famous Iris dataset to classify flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on features like petal and sepal dimensions.  
**Key steps included:**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization
- Applying ML models like Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN
- Model accuracy comparison

### 2. **Sales Prediction Using Python**
**Notebook:** `Sales Prediction Project.ipynb`  
A regression-based project to predict sales based on advertising/marketing spend or related features.  
**Highlights:**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Correlation and feature analysis
- Linear Regression model training
- Error evaluation using MAE, MSE, RMSE

### 3. **Titanic Survival Prediction**
**Notebook:** `Titanic code file.ipynb`  
This project predicts the survival of passengers from the Titanic dataset using classification algorithms.  
**Key tasks performed:**
- Handling missing values
- Feature engineering (e.g., encoding categorical variables)
- Training models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree
- Evaluating model performance
